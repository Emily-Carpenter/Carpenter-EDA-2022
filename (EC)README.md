Predicting Human-Wolf Conflict in Minnesota
Emily Carpenter, Biosciences Department MSUM
Abstract
In Minnesota, the wolf population has been on the rise for the last few decades. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resourcesâ€™ Division of Fish and Wildlife (DNR) has been following the wolf population very closely, but how not been looking at the data with regard to anything else. This data analysis looks at overlapping population numbers from three different sources to see if human wolf conflict can be predicted. For this research, data was collected from the DNR, Minnesota State Demographic Center and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture. By analyzing the data, we were able to reach predictions of potential predation by wolves. After comparing the densities of the populations by counties, conclusions were able  to be reached. In the state maps provided, the counties with the lighter blue are areas where there is a higher risk of predation and conflict between the stated groups.
